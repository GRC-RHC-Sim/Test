<b>Introduction</b> <br>
The Toolbox for the Modeling and Analysis of Thermodynamic Systems (T-MATS) 
is a Simulink toolbox intended for use in the modeling and simulation of thermodynamic 
systems and their controls. T-MATS contains generic thermodynamic and controls 
components that may be combined with a variable input iterative solver and optimization 
algorithm to create complex systems to meet the needs of a developer. Development of this tool
was completed on behalf of the NASA Aviation Safety Program's Vehicle Systems Safety Technologies
(VSST) project.
